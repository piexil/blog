 <b>Edit:</b> Since originally posting this, I have edited the blog again. This time adding categories (uses Material.io icons), and the start of pagination.

 The old update message is below: 


>I have just updated this blog with new features. Including a special "Image Post" that adds an image to
>the top of a post, and sets the background (eventually I'll let it have seperate backgrounds). I have
>also added tags, the ability to show all posts with certain tags, et cetera. There's some new minor
>changes as well. Including new psot sizes and proper mobile relfowing.
