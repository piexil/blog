So recently I have had the desire to create a blog so that I can share work on projects with my friends, family, and potential employers. I wanted something simple. Just the posts and eventually things like images. Wordpress and Gost were both a pain to setup, and required things that could potentially be a secuirty hole. If I'm going to be the only person writing posts, why bother with a whole dynamic applicaton? 

I came across a static web page compiler called hugo and this completley solved my issue with blogging software being too bloated for the small time blogger. I can control exactly how much I want. I also have completle control over how it looks. I didn't really like any of the theme options avalible at the hugo page, so I rolled my own based off of my personal website. 

You can view the source to all of this here, at my <a href="https://github.com/piexil/blog">github</a>, the reason I use github as I actually use that as a way to sync the local dev copy of this site to the vps it's run off of. That allows me to write posts from anywhere I have SSH, Git, and a text editor.
