      <description>So recently I have had the desire to create a blog so that I can share work on projects with my friends, family, and potential employers. I wanted something simple. Just the posts and eventually things like images. Wordpress and Gost were both a pain to setup, and required things that could potentially be a secuirty hole. If I&amp;rsquo;m going to be the only person writing posts, why bother with a whole dynamic applicaton?</description>
